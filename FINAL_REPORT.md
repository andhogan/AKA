  * ##### What we completed
At the start of the semester, we set out to develop a web application to track hiking metrics for users that could be utililzed to encourage this activity. Through each milestone, we learned different tools and project management skills that ulitimately helped us to complete our working application. We were able to successully complete a number of different features and tasks for our project over the semester and followed the guidelines specified and defined in each project milestone. We were able to leverage Flask as our web framework to implement URL routing and template rendering for our various HTML pages. Flask allowed us to use extensions to add in different functionalities, such as Flask-Login to handle user sessions, Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM, Flask-WTF for form validation, and Flask-Bcrypt for password hashing. In total, we implemented 9 HTML pages that used a combination of static and dynamic data to display text content, images, and user data. These pages were formatted through tables, grids, containers, buttons, and navbars. We leveraged a single HTML file to be inherited by all other pages to keep each page consistent within our app. All of these HTML pages utilized Bootstrap with a combination of in-built JavaScript and CSS to provide consistency of style and dynamic features. We implemented our back-end through SQLite and SQLAlchemy to store site and user data through three primary tables and two join tables. Various acceptance and integration tests were run to test Data Access Methods, HTML rendering and URL / endpoint behaviour.  We successfully deployed our app on PythonAnywhere and presented a final walk-through. Throughout the semster we got experience in version control and project management through Github and Trello and will walk away with more expertise in both.  Overall, we felt the project was a success and enjoyed the experience.
 * ##### What we were in the middle of implementing
There were a few things we would have liked to add to the application but were unable to due to time constraints. These included creating a more visually pleasing Achievements page, and to be able to allow the user to see all stats logged for a peak instead of just the first time they hiked it. 
 * ##### What we had planned for the future
   * We would have liked to add a location feature based on the user's current location that would suggest peaks closest to them.
   * We would also have liked to have merged a lifetime stats page that recorded cumulative additions to user stats over multiple hikes along with the user achievements page offering forward facing view of all available achievements to acquire. 
 * ##### Known problems (bugs, issues)
As we were testing and playing around with the site we did come accross a few bugs. Most were fixed before deployment. One that was not was the ability to see user stats on the peak page. The only "My Stats" that show are the first ones logged and if you log new stats over top of those it does not show them it just continues to show you the original logged stats.
