### Final Status Report:
  * ##### What we completed
    * At the start of the semester, we set out to develop a web application to track hiking metrics for users that could be utililzed to encourage this activity. Through each milestone, we learned different tools and project management skills that ulitimately helped us to complete our working application. We were able to successully complete a number of different features and tasks for our project over the semester and followed the guidelines specified and defined in each project milestone. We were able to leverage Flask as our web framework to implement URL routing and template rendering for our various HTML pages. Flask allowed us to use extensions to add in different functionalities, such as Flask-Login to handle user sessions, Flask-SQLAlchemy for ORM, Flask-WTF for form validation, and Flask-Bcrypt for password hashing. In total, we implemented 9 HTML pages that used a combination of static and dynamic data to display text content, images, and user data, formatted through tables, grids, containers, buttons, and navbars. We leveraged a single HTML file to be inherited by all other pages to keep each page consistent within our app. All of these HTML pages utilized Bootstrap with a combination of in-built JavaScript and CSS to provide consistency of style and dynamic features. We implemented our back-end through SQLite and SQLAlchemy to store site and user data through three primary tables and two join tables. Various acceptance and integration tests were run to test Data Access Methods, HTML rendering and URL / endpoint behaviour.  We successfully deployed our app on PythonAnywhere and presented a final walk-through. Throughout the semster we got experience in version control and project management through Github and Trello and will walk away with more expertise in both.  Overall, we felt the project was a success and enjoyed the experience.
